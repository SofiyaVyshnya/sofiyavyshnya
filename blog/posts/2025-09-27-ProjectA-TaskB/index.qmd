## A Patient’s Hope

> “Thanks, Sofie,” said Mrs. H, squeezing my hand. 
She was suffering from a chronic leg wound, for which few treatments were available. I knew I could do more. Mrs. H’s hope for a cure inspired me to pursue **clinical-translational research**, and it became a defining moment in my journey toward becoming a physician-scientist.



## From Compassion to Research

During my undergraduate studies, I wanted to learn how I could one day address unmet clinical needs like Mrs. H's. I joined Dr. Edward Botchwey’s lab to explore **stem cell therapies for regenerative medicine**. I applied **statistical and machine learning approaches** to identify biomarkers in stem cells that correlated with therapeutic outcomes. It was here that I realized the need for **personalizing teatment approaches**.

To explore my intetest in computational research and personalized medicine, I joined Dr. May Wang’s lab. There, I developed a **personalized model for predicting heart disease risk**. This experience reinforced how computational tools can enable **precision medicine** by helping clinicians make patient-specific decisions. It was here that I realized the unique power of the MD-PhD path: combining deep clinical insight with technical expertise to develop therapies tailored toward each patient.



## Entering the MD-PhD Phase

### AI for Cancer Management

</div>
As an MD-PhD student at Case Western Reserve University, I now integrate **MRI, pathology imaging, and AI** in the **INVent Lab** to personalize cancer care. Working alongside radiologists, pathologists, and oncologists, I help develop predictive models to identify patients who may benefit from **less invasive treatments**, learning that effective therapy always depends on **individual patient characteristics**.



## Looking Ahead

I aspire to **bridge AI research and clinical practice**, developing tools that improve patient outcomes and make personalized medicine **the standard of care**. Beyond research, I am passionate about **mentoring, science communication, and community outreach**, sharing biomedical innovation with students and the public alike.
