## Building the Website
I built the website in Quarto using a custom structure inspired by <a href="https://www.jhelvy.com/">Dr. John Paul Helveston's personal website</a> at George Washington University (<a href="https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy_quarto/blob/main/index.qmd">>GitHub</a>) and the <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/masiello/research/">Masiello Group's website</a> at the University of Washington (<a href="https://github.com/MasielloGroup/MasielloGroupWebsite/blob/main/index.qmd">GitHub</a>). I utilized <a href="https://github.com/LyonsZhang/431-projectA-2025/blob/main/dashboard1.qmd">Dr. Zhang's</a> and <a href="https://github.com/atepp2001/atepp2001.github.io/blob/main/dashboard-main/dashboard.qmd">Alex Epp's</a> templates for the dashboard.

## Central Hypothesis

My central hypothesis for this study is that middle-aged adults (age 40-65) adults with heavy metal exposure (particularly lead exposure) have higher systolic blood pressure. This question is motivated by several studies showing a link between high blood lead levels and elevated prevalence of cardiovascular disease, potentially as a result of inflammation.  To test this hypothesis, I used data gathered from NHANES during the years of 2017-March 2020 (the pre-pandemic years). First, I conducted data visualization and exploration (Study 1) to understand the data distributions, variable relationships, and trends. Next, I modeled the relationship between systolic blood pressure and the concentrations of 3 heavy metals (lead, cadmium, and manganese) while also controlling for demographic covariates.


## Dataset Description
The NHANES dataset from 2017-2020 consists of 9254 observations collected from individuals age 0-80. After filtering for individuals ages 40-65, 2475 observations were left. Missing data were imputed assuming missing at random (Study 2) or dropped (Study 1). For Study 1, concentrations of heavy metals in the blood were log-normalized.

# Methods
## High Blood Pressure Prevalence
First, I calculated the prevalence of high blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure was binarized (HighBP: 1 = systolic BP > 140 mmHg, 0 = systolic BP $\leq$ 140 mmHg, where 1 represents high blood pressure and 0 represents low-normal blood pressure). Prevalence was computed as the fraction of cases with high blood pressure (HighBP = 1). 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Next, I conducted some preliminary data visualization and statistical testing to explore data distributions, variable relationships, and understand overall trends. I examined the prevalence of high blood pressure (outcome vaiable) by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. I created linear models (ANOVA equivalent) to compare mean systolic blood pressure between different racial/ethnic groups and conducted a univariate t-test (equivalent of univariate OLS) to compare mean blood pressure by sex. I computed Cohen's d to assess effect size.  I also compared the prevalence of high blood pressure (systolic BP > 140 mmHg) by sex and racial/ethnic groups using Chi squared testing and relied on Cramer's V for effect size.

Likewise, I examined blood concentrations of the 3 heavy metals by demographic group. I plotted the distributions of blood lead, cadmium, and manganese concentrations in my dashboard. For lead, I also examined the distribution of blood lead levels by sex, age, and racial/ethnic group.

Finally, I created a linear model (OLS) that integrates all the variables to answer my question and understand to what extent blood lead levels are associated with systolic blood pressure, after controlling for demographic covariates, which influence systolic blood pressure as well. 

# Results and Conclusions
Demographic factors had the strongest relationship with systolic blood pressure. In particular black race ($\beta_1$ = 3.98, p = 0.001) was strongly associated with increased systolic BP, while non-Hispanic white race and ethnicity ($\beta_1$ = -3.11, p = 0.009) was associated with decreased systolic blood pressure. Female sex was also strongly associated with lower blood pressure ($\beta_1$ = -2.27, p = 0.003). Surprisingly, blood lead levels were not associated significantly with systolic blood pressure ($\beta_1$ = -0.11, p = 0.882) and also did not have a clear relationship with any of the demographic groups. The distributions of blood lead levels were virtually the same across all ages, sexes, and racial/ethnic groups. In conclusion, I learned that systolic blood pressure is strongly related with demographic data but has no relationship with blood lead levels.
