I am an MD-PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, where I am pursuing my long-term goal of advancing personalized medicine. I am deeply motivated by the belief that medical care should be tailored to each individualâ€”making treatments not only more effective, but also more streamlined, affordable, and accessible to all patients.

My current research focuses on integrating MRI, pathology imaging, and artificial intelligence to personalize cancer management. By combining insights across different imaging modalities with advanced computational methods, I aim to develop tools that help clinicians deliver the right treatment to the right patient at the right time.

Beyond research, I am passionate about science communication, mentoring, and community outreach. I enjoy helping others discover science, supporting students as they find their paths in STEM, and engaging with the public to make complex scientific ideas approachable and meaningful.

Looking ahead, I aspire to build a career at the intersection of medicine, engineering, and innovation, working toward a future where personalized medicine is the standard of care.
