    "text": "3.1 Data Imputation\n\n3.1.1 Demonstration of Missing Data & Investigating Patterns of Data Missingness (MCAR, MAR, NMAR)\nFirst, I want to find out any patterns in my missing values to understand whether the data is missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), or missing not at random (MNAR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 9 √ó 3\n  variable n_miss pct_miss\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1 BPXSY1      378    15.3 \n2 BPXDI1      378    15.3 \n3 LBXBPB      197     7.96\n4 LBXBCD      197     7.96\n5 LBXBMN      197     7.96\n6 SEQN          0     0   \n7 RIDAGEYR      0     0   \n8 RIAGENDR      0     0   \n9 RIDRETH1      0     0   \n\n\nThe data is not missing completely at random. Missingness is observed in blocks/clusters: one cluster is for lab values (LBXBPB, LBXBCD, LBXBMN) and another is for blood pressure readings (BPXSY1, BPXDI1). Individuals who are missing one lab value are also going to be missing the others. Likewise, individuals who are missing one blood pressure reading will also be missing the others. Furthermore, it‚Äôs possible that individuals missing lab values are also more likely to have blood pressure readings missing. To investigate this, I will use a Chi square test to see if there is any dependency in the missingness of lab values and blood pressure:\n\n\n   \n       0    1\n  0 2015  263\n  1   82  115\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction\n\ndata:  tab\nX-squared = 303.69, df = 1, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\nCramer V \n  0.3524 \n\n\nThe significant test result and moderate effect size suggests some dependency: individuals missing lab values are also somewhat more likely to have BP values missing (or vice versa?).\nNext, I want to check if the missingness is associated with observed covariates. This makes it more likely that the missing values are MAR.\n\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = lab_missing ~ RIDAGEYR + RIAGENDR + RIDRETH1, family = binomial, \n    data = nhanes_filtered)\n\nCoefficients:\n                            Estimate Std.

Therefore, I can plausibly assume that the data is missing at random (MAR). However, for blood pressure values, that does not seem to be the case. It is therefore possible that missingness is driven by some unobserved variable and BP values could be NMAR. However, for the purposes of this assignment, I will assume that all data is MAR. Thus, standard imputation methods like multiple imputation (MICE) are appropriate.\n\n\n3.1.2 Imputation Method: MICE (Based on Desired Model that uses heavy metal concentrations in the blood + race/ethnicity + sex to predict systolic blood pressure)\nI used predictive mean matching (PMM) for continuous variables. The categorical variables in the dataset (sex, race/ethnicity) had no missing values according to the heatmap in the section ‚ÄúDemonstration of Missing Data & Investigating Patterns of Data Missingness (MCAR, MAR, NMAR)‚Äù. Only predictor variables were imputed; the outcome variable, systolic blood pressure (BPXSY1), was not imputed.\n\nlibrary(mice)\n\n# Impute filtered dataset \n# Define methods per variable\nmeth &lt;- make.method(nhanes_filtered)\nmeth[c(\"LBXBPB\", \"LBXBCD\", \"LBXBMN\")] &lt;- \"pmm\"\nmeth[\"SEQN\"] &lt;- \"\"  # ID variable excluded\n\n# Perform imputation\nset.seed(123)\nimp &lt;- mice(\n  nhanes_filtered,\n  m = 1,       # single imputed dataset\n  method = meth,\n  maxit = 20,\n  printFlag = FALSE    # &lt;-- suppress iteration output\n)\n\n# Complete data after imputation\nnhanes_imputed &lt;- complete(imp, 1)\n\n\n\n       SEQN    RIDAGEYR    RIAGENDR    RIDRETH1      LBXBPB      LBXBCD \n          0           0           0           0           0           0 \n     LBXBMN      BPXSY1      BPXDI1 lab_missing  bp_missing \n          0           0           0           0           0 \n\n\nThe only missing values should be in the outcome variable, not the predictor variables."

To test this hypothesis, I am using data gathered from NHANES during the years of 2017-March 2020 (the pre-pandemic years). In this study (Study 1 analyses), I am simply exploring the data and learning about the distributions of each of my variables of interest (sex, race/ethnicity, and heavy metal concentrations in the blood)."

    "text": "6.1 Analysis B: Comparing 2 Means with Independent Samples (Blood Lead Levels by Sex)\nQuestion: Is the blood lead level different in males and females?\nDataset Description: The dataset was stratified by sex. Mean blood lead levels (LBXBPB_clean_log), were compared between the two sexes (male, female). There were 769 males and 821 females in the dataset.\nMain analysis: A two-tailed t-test was used to compare the difference in mean blood lead levels (log-transformed) between males and females. A significance level of 0.1 was used. The effect size (Cohen‚Äôs d) was also computed (small: 0.2, medium: 0.5, large: 0.8). This set-up is essentially equivalent to univariate OLS, where the beta coefficient (\\(\\beta_1\\)) corresponds to the difference in means of the two groups and the intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)) corresponds to the mean lead concentration of the reference group. OLS assumes that the data (or rather, the errors) follow a normal distribution, the errors are independent, and the errors have a constant variance. \\[log(lead\\_conc) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(male\\_sex)\\] \\[lead\\_conc = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(male\\_sex)}\\] \\[\\text{Fold change }lead\\_conc = e^{\\beta_1}\\]\nConclusions: The median blood lead level was 0.71 ¬± 0.25 (mean ¬± SD) for males and 0.65 ¬± 0.25 for females, which translates to a 6% (difference in means: 0.71-0.65 = 0.06 \\(\\rightarrow\\) fold change: \\(e^{0.06} = 1.06\\), \\(\\rightarrow\\) 6% increase) difference in blood lead concentrations between males and females. The difference was statistically significant at the 0.1 level, but the effect size was low (0.26). I conclude that males and females have no appreciable difference in blood lead levels.\nNote: The same analyses were conducted for other numeric variables: blood cadmium level (LBXBCD), blood manganese level (LBXBMN), systolic blood pressure (BPXSY1), and diastolic blood pressure (BPXDI1).\n\n\n# A tibble: 9 √ó 6\n  descriptor  LBXBPB_clean_log LBXBCD_clean_log LBXBMN_clean_log BPXSY1_clean\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 n_Male               769              769              769          769    \n2 n_Female             821              821              821          821    \n3 mean_Male              0.711            0.265            2.29       127.   \n4 mean_Female            0.646            0.330            2.36       125.   \n5 sd_Male                0.248            0.168            0.280       15.2  \n6 sd_Female              0.251            0.165            0.281       16.1  \n7 t_statistic            5.15            -7.86            -4.87         2.40 \n8 p_value                0                0                0            0.017\n9 cohen_d                0.258           -0.395           -0.244        0.12 \n# ‚Ñπ 1 more variable: BPXDI1_clean &lt;dbl&gt;"

    "text": "6.2 Analysis C: Comparing Blood Lead Levels Across Races\nQuestion: Are blood lead levels different between races?\nDataset Description: The dataset was stratified by race (Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, other/multiracial). Mean blood levels of lead (LBXBPB_clean_log), were compared across the 5 racial/ethnic groups. There were 459 individuals identifying as non-Hispanic white, 249 individuals identifying as Mexican American, 179 as other Hispanic, 376 as non-Hispanic black, and 327 as other/multiracial.\nMain analysis: Race/ethnicity was dummy-coded. A multivariate OLS model was used to compare mean blood lead levels, setting non-Hispanic white as the reference group. A significance level of 0.1 was used. This set-up is similar to an ANOVA followed by post-hoc testing. OLS assumes that the errors are iid, follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0, and have constant variance.\nConclusions: The mean blood lead level was 0.64 ¬± 0.25 (mean ¬± SD) for non-Hispanic whites, 0.66 ¬± 0.24 for Mexican Americans, 0.59 ¬± 0.24 for other Hispanics, 0.71 ¬± 0.26 for blacks, and 0.74 ¬± 0.24 for multiracial individuals. This translates into a 1.7% increase in blood lead levels in Mexican Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites, a 5.2% decrease in other Hispanics, a 6.23% increase in black individuals, and a 10.0% increase in blood lead levels multiracial individuals. All the comparisons were statistically significant except for Mexican Americans, whose blood lead levels were closer to the reference group.
