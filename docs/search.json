    "text": "From Compassion to Research\n During my undergraduate studies, I wanted to learn how I could one day address unmet clinical needs like Mrs.¬†H‚Äôs. I joined Dr.¬†Edward Botchwey‚Äôs lab to explore personalized stem cell therapies. I applied statistical and machine learning approaches to identify biomarkers in stem cells that correlated with therapeutic outcomes.\nLater, in Dr.¬†May Wang‚Äôs lab, I developed a personalized model for predicting heart disease risk. This experience reinforced how computational tools can enable precision medicine by helping clinicians make patient-specific decisions. It was here that I realized the unique power of the MD-PhD path: combining deep clinical insight with technical expertise to develop truly personalized therapies."
