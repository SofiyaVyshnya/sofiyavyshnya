### Overview

My research is driven by a long-term goal of advancing **personalized medicine**. I focus on integrating **MRI, pathology imaging, and artificial intelligence** to improve cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, with the ultimate aim of making therapies more **precise, efficient, and accessible** for every patient.  

I am particularly interested in:  

- **Multimodal imaging integration:** Combining MRI and pathology data to capture the full complexity of tumors and improve diagnostic accuracy.  
- **Machine learning for therapy personalization:** Developing predictive models that help clinicians select the optimal treatment for individual patients.  
- **Translational impact:** Creating tools that can be incorporated into clinical workflows to support real-world patient care.

### Future Directions

Looking ahead, I aim to expand my work to **broader applications of personalized medicine**, combining imaging, genomics, and AI-driven decision support to help bring precision therapies from the lab to the clinic efficiently.
